# MNIST-mostly-from-scratch
Neural network built from scratch, but utilizes https://pypi.org/project/python-mnist/ to parse dataset and numpy for optimization

Work in progress; needs additional optimization to run in reasonable time.
I have plans to switch the network to softmax and cross entropy in a future version.
